        "19. How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "20. How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: If residuals fan out or form patterns in plots, heteroscedasticity may be present. It weakens the reliability of inference and confidence intervals.\n",

        "21. What does it mean if a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high R² but low adjusted R²?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: It means some predictors don't improve the model, and R² is artificially inflated. Adjusted R² penalizes unnecessary variables.\n",
